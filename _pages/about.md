<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently pursuing a PhD at the [State Key Laboratory of Mesoscience and Engineering](https://www.mesolab.ac.cn), [Institute of Process Engineering](http://english.ipe.cas.cn), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn), under the supervision of Associate Researcher [Meng Fanyong](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0037928).

My research focuses on interdisciplinary studies in multiphase flow measurement, fluid mechanics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am working on the detection, characterization, and generation of highly overlapping scenarios in multiphase flows.

3DBubbles: An Experimental Dataset for Model Training and Benchmarking(**cs**)

**Baodi Yu**, Qian Chen Yanwei Qin, Sunyang Wang, Xiaohui Su, Fanyong Meng*

[**Code**](https://github.com/AI4CT/3DBubbles)¬∑[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ai4ctofipe/3dbubbles)¬∑[**Zenodo**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15636832)
- **Objective**: Addressed a critical bottleneck in fluid dynamics research: the lack of high-quality, large-scale experimental datasets of 3D bubble structures for training and benchmarking Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.
- **Methodology**: Developed a novel method for dataset construction by preparing static bubbly flow phantoms, digitizing over 10,000 real 3D bubble structures using an in-house X-ray CT system, and characterizing them with Spherical Harmonic (SH) analysis for efficient compression.
- **Contribution**: Constructed and open-sourced the "3DBubbles" dataset, providing the scientific community with physically plausible 3D ground-truth bubble geometries and their rendered 2D projections, which serve as valuable benchmark data for robust training and rigorous evaluation of AI models, particularly for 2D-to-3D reconstruction tasks.

[Exploring model generalizability from a novel perspective](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3049-4761/addac6/pdf)

Sunyang Wang, **Baodi Yu**, Fanyong Meng*

- **Objective**: To address the dual challenges in dynamic CT for multiphase flows: severe limited-angle artifacts due to incomplete data acquisition and prohibitively long reconstruction times of traditional iterative algorithms.
- **Methodology**: Developed a deep-learning-enhanced reconstruction algorithm that integrates a rapid SIRT method with a U-Net model, efficiently removing artifacts and restoring structures in the image domain.
- **Contribution**: Reduced reconstruction time by nearly two orders of magnitude (e.g., from 4.8 hours to 3 minutes) while ensuring high-quality results, providing a key technology for high-spatiotemporal-resolution analysis of dynamic flow fields

[Deep-learning Enhanced CT Reconstruction Algorithm for Multiphase-flow Measurement](https://www.cttacn.org.cn/cn/article/doi/10.15953/j.ctta.2025.097)

Qian Chen, **Baodi Yu**, Yanwei Qin, Sunyang Wang, Xiaohui Su, Xin Jin, Fanyong Meng*

- **Objective**: To address the key challenge of lacking a unified mechanistic explanation for the generalizability of Machine Learning (ML) models by establishing a novel theoretical framework with causal explanatory power.
- **Methodology**: Introduced the "Compromise in Competition" (CIC) principle from mesoscience, identifying the interplay between "memorizing" and "forgetting" as the core competing mechanisms that govern a model's final behavior.
- **Contribution**: This framework provides a new causal interpretation for overfitting (as the result of memorizing excessively dominating forgetting) and reinterprets the mechanisms of techniques like regularization, offering a new perspective on AI interpretability.

Qian Chen, **Baodi Yu**, Xiaohui Su, Yanwei Qin, Sunyang Wang, Fanyong Meng*. (CN202411542959.8, Substantive Examination)

- **Objective**: To solve the core difficulty in evaluating the performance of dynamic CT scanners for multiphase flow: the inability to obtain the 3D ground truth of a real, transient flow field for accurate performance calibration.
- **Methodology**: Invented a "quasi-dynamic phantom" featuring a solid "flow-field pillar" with fixed internal bubble structures. This pillar is moved at controlled speeds to simulate a repeatable and predictable dynamic flow field.
- **Contribution**: This method allows for the acquisition of both dynamic CT data and its corresponding, precisely assembled static ground-truth data. By comparing the two (e.g., via SSIM), the scanner's accuracy at various speeds can be quantitatively evaluated to determine its "maximum trustworthy test speed".

[Flow field measurement data compression and storage method and system](https://cprs.patentstar.com.cn/Search/Detail?ANE=AIHA6AGA3ABA7DBA4ADA6DCA4EAA9CIF9EAAAIAA9HCC7FCA)

**Baodi Yu**, Fanyong Meng*. (CN202311045920.0, Substantive Examination)

- **Objective**: To address the massive data volume from high-resolution flow-field measurements (e.g., high-speed cameras) which creates immense storage and transmission pressure, and the inability of traditional pixel-based compression to preserve key physical structures.

- **Methodology**: Proposed a novel structure-based compression method that uses a deep neural network to automatically detect key structures (e.g., bubbles) in the flow field  and extracts their geometric and physical information into low-dimensional parameters for efficient binary storage.
- **Contribution**: This method achieves an extremely high compression ratio (approx. 290:1 in the example) , significantly saving storage space while preserving physically meaningful structural information and enabling subsequent flow-field reconstruction.
