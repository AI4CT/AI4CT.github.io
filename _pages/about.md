<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently pursuing a PhD at the [State Key Laboratory of Mesoscience and Engineering](https://www.mesolab.ac.cn), [Institute of Process Engineering](http://english.ipe.cas.cn), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn), under the supervision of Associate Researcher [Meng Fanyong](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0037928).

My research focuses on interdisciplinary studies in multiphase flow measurement, fluid mechanics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am working on the detection, characterization, and generation of highly overlapping scenarios in multiphase flows.

[Exploring model generalizability from a novel perspective](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3049-4761/addac6/pdf)

Sunyang Wang, **Baodi Yu**, Fanyong Meng*

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- **Challenge**: To address the dual challenges in dynamic CT for multiphase flows: severe limited-angle artifacts due to incomplete data acquisition and prohibitively long reconstruction times of traditional iterative algorithms.
- **Method**: Developed a deep-learning-enhanced reconstruction algorithm that integrates a rapid SIRT method with a U-Net model, efficiently removing artifacts and restoring structures in the image domain.
- **Impact**: Reduced reconstruction time by nearly two orders of magnitude (e.g., from 4.8 hours to 3 minutes) while ensuring high-quality results, providing a key technology for high-spatiotemporal-resolution analysis of dynamic flow fields

[Deep-learning Enhanced CT Reconstruction Algorithm for Multiphase-flow Measurement](https://www.cttacn.org.cn/cn/article/doi/10.15953/j.ctta.2025.097)

Qian Chen, **Baodi Yu**, Yanwei Qin, Sunyang Wang, Xiaohui Su, Xin Jin, Fanyong Meng*

- **Objective**: To address the key challenge of lacking a unified mechanistic explanation for the generalizability of Machine Learning (ML) models by establishing a novel theoretical framework with causal explanatory power.
- **Methodology**: Introduced the "Compromise in Competition" (CIC) principle from mesoscience, identifying the interplay between "memorizing" and "forgetting" as the core competing mechanisms that govern a model's final behavior.
- **Contribution**: This framework provides a new causal interpretation for overfitting (as the result of memorizing excessively dominating forgetting) and reinterprets the mechanisms of techniques like regularization, offering a new perspective on AI interpretability.
