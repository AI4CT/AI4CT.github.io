<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the National Key Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Associate Researcher Meng Fanyong.

My research focuses on interdisciplinary studies in multiphase flow measurement, fluid mechanics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am working on the detection, characterization, and generation of highly overlapping scenarios in multiphase flows.
