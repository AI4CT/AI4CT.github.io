I am currently pursuing a PhD at the [State Key Laboratory of Mesoscience and Engineering](https://www.mesolab.ac.cn), [Institute of Process Engineering](http://english.ipe.cas.cn), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn), under the supervision of Associate Researcher [Meng Fanyong](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0037928).

My research focuses on interdisciplinary studies in multiphase flow measurement, fluid mechanics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am working on the detection, characterization, and generation of highly overlapping scenarios in multiphase flows.
